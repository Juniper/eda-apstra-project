# Note: nutanix_event, entity, and subnet variables are provided by EDA
# No need to define them here - they will be available automatically

# Internal processing variables (computed from EDA event data in tasks)
# These are documented here for reference but set dynamically:
# - vnet_name (extracted from entity.name)
# - vnet_uuid (extracted from entity.uuid) 
# - vlan_id (extracted from subnet.vlan_id)
# - subnet_cidr (computed from subnet.subnet_ip/prefix_length)
# - gateway_ip (extracted from subnet.default_gateway_ip)
# - blueprint_name (retrieved from ConfigMap)
# - is_deletion (computed from nutanix_event.event_type)
